I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The file "requirements.txt" is not located in the "js" directory. It's usually located in the root directory of a Python project and it's used to list the Python packages required to run the project. 

If you want to see the content of "requirements.txt", please use the correct path: "AI_Pitch_Deck_Generator/requirements.txt".
